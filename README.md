# LangChain Learning Resources

Welcome to the comprehensive course on **"Developing LLM Web Applications with Python"**. This guide outlines the prerequisites and key concepts to ensure a robust foundation for leveraging Python and LangChain effectively.

## Prerequisites

To maximize your learning experience, the following prerequisites are essential:

- **Proficiency in Basic Python Concepts**: Familiarity with fundamental constructs such as `print` statements, variables, data types, control structures (for and while loops, conditional statements), and object-oriented programming principles (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism).
- **Environment Setup Expertise**: Ability to configure development environments and utilise `pip` for package installations.
- **OpenAI API Access**: Possession of preloaded API credits for OpenAI or use of the pay-as-you-go model with an associated credit card.

## OpenAI Integration

This section delves into foundational OpenAI concepts and best practices to streamline API integration:

- **API Key Management**: Understand the critical role of API keys in connecting to OpenAI servers and adopt best practices for securely storing these credentials.
- **`ChatCompletions` API Utilisation**: Gain expertise in implementing the `ChatCompletions` API through the OpenAI Python SDK.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Comprehend and effectively apply the roles of `System`, `User`, and `Assistant` in crafting prompts to guide the modelâ€™s responses.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Develop an understanding of key hyperparameters and their impact, enabling you to fine-tune model outputs for nuanced and contextually appropriate responses.
